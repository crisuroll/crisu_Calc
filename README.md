	-> The calculator doesn't work with float numbers, only integers. Percentages will appear as an int number, deleting the decimals.

### 2. Negative numbers
- The calculator can tell if the symbol `-` is the operator of subtract or the negative sign to make a negative number. The calculator can do operations with negative numbers.


### 3.  Easter egg
