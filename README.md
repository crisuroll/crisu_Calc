# 🐹 crisu Calculator

## 👀 Overview

Welcome to a basic calculator made with Java, using the Swing library!

**DISCLAIMER: All Javadoc and commentaries from the code are in Spanish, I'll translate them later

## 🌟 Key Features

### v1
- **Basic operations**: You can add, subtract, multiply and divide, but only with two INTEGER numbers
- **Cute GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface with pastel colors
- **Other operations**: Added pow, square root and percentages
- **What is that star...?**: Easter egg button. Nothing dangerous tho :)

### v2 (in progress...)
...

## 🗂️ Some testing!

![basic operations](https://github.com/crisuroll/crisu_Calc/blob/main/README%20src/Basic%20ops.gif))
- Reset button to delete everything written.

- Other operations such as pow, square root and percentages.

	-> The calculator doesn't work with float numbers, only integers. Percentages will appear as an int number, deleting the decimals.

### 2. Negative numbers
- The calculator can tell if the symbol `-` is the operator of subtract or the negative sign to make a negative number. The calculator can do operations with negative numbers.


### 3.  Easter egg
I'll explain what is the star function in case no one trust it! I'll hide it in case you want to discover it by yourself...

  The pink button with a white start just redirects to my GitHub profile when clicked.
