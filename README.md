# üêπ crisu Calculator

## üëÄ Overview

Welcome to a basic calculator made with Java, using the Swing library!

**DISCLAIMER: All Javadoc and commentaries from the code are in Spanish, I'll translate them later

## üåü Key Features

### v1
- **Basic operations**: You can add, subtract, multiply and divide, but only with two INTEGER numbers
- **Cute GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface with pastel colors
- **Other operations**: Added pow, square root and percentages
- **What is that star...?**: Easter egg button. Nothing dangerous tho :)

### v2
- **New button ‚å´**: Instead of deleting the whole display as R button does, this new button deletes character by character
- **Added bases**: You can operate in binary, octal, decimal and hex
- **Replaced star button**: OWNER button does the same function, redirects to my GitHub profile
- **More extra buttons!**: INFO button pops up a new window; CASIO button redirects to their calculator shop

## üóÇÔ∏è Some testing!

### 1. Basic operations
- Basic operations! Add, subtract, multiply, divide.
![basic operations](https://github.com/crisuroll/crisu_Calc/blob/main/README%20src/Basic%20ops.gif)

	-> As you can see while doing the division, the calculator doesn't work with float numbers, only integers. Percentages will appear as an int number, deleting the decimals.

  
- Reset button to delete everything written.

- Other operations such as pow, square root and percentages.

### 2. Negative numbers
- The calculator can tell if the symbol `-` is the operator of subtract or the negative sign to make a negative number. The calculator can do operations with negative numbers.

### 3.  Easter egg (only v1)
I'll explain what is the star function in case no one trust it! I'll hide it in case you want to discover it by yourself...

<details>
  <summary>What does the star mean...?</summary>
  The pink button with a white start just redirects to my GitHub profile when clicked.
  
</details>

### 4.	Operations with different bases**
You can operate in binary, octal, decimal and hex. Also, the display value converts to the base selected.

You can't convert in the middle of an operation tho. Also, you have to select a base before start operating.
